Typically, coding interviews focus on data structures and algorithms, while other technical rounds may encompass system design (especially for middle to senior level candidates). A coding interview round is typically 30 - 45 minutes. You will be given a technical question (or questions) by the interviewer and will be expected to write code in a real-time collaborative editor such as CodePen or CoderPad (phone screen/virtual onsite) or on a whiteboard (onsite) to solve the problem within the given time.",
